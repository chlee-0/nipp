Minor corrections to Gordon Nipp's Tables of Quaternary Quadratic Forms (http://www.math.rwth-aachen.de/~Gabriele.Nebe/LATTICES/nipp.html)

The following file contains corrected p-adic densities and p-adic Jordan splittings in the Appendix of Nipp's book :
- `nipp.dat`

For a brief description of these tables, see Minor corrections to Nipp's tables of quaternary quadratic forms (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08459).
